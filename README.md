# Smart Ambulance Dispatch and ER Capacity Management System

The Smart Ambulance Dispatch and ER Capacity Management System is a web-based application designed to improve emergency medical response by intelligently dispatching ambulances, optimizing routes, and selecting suitable hospitals based on real-time ER availability.

## About

The Smart Ambulance Dispatch and ER Capacity Management System enhances coordination between emergency services, ambulances, and hospitals. Traditional emergency response systems often suffer from delayed dispatch, inefficient routing, and lack of real-time visibility into hospital capacity. This project addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform that processes emergency requests and dynamically assigns ambulances and hospitals.

The system evaluates ambulance proximity, traffic conditions, and hospital ER capacity to recommend the most efficient response. By automating decision-making and providing real-time monitoring, the platform reduces response times, prevents emergency room overcrowding, and improves patient outcomes.
